Hi! I’m Holland, a data engineer and analyst with 3+ years of experience designing infrastructure, building data pipelines, training machine learning models, and leading statistical analyses for medical and psychology research teams. I got into data engineering because I love to build things people trust and use every day.

I earned my B.S. in Computational Methods and Cognitive Science, two disciplines I chose for their power to explain human decision-making, from mental healthcare to economic behavior. I later expanded my foundation in Python, inferential statistics, and behavioral data analysis with graduate coursework in applied machine learning at Cornell University.

At Weill Cornell Medicine, I put those skills to work as a data engineer on a psychiatry research team, where I designed scalable data infrastructure and integrated AI image processing pipelines for treatment development studies — one of which was published in an academic journal.

#### __*Building systems that people love to use always starts with strong communication.*__

In my past roles, I’ve worn many hats: infrastructure and database administration, data flow, MLOps, platform engineering, and dashboarding for research and clinical teams. Those experiences have taught me that understanding team workflows is key to identifying tasks that can be streamlined or automated, or what tools could be aggregated with smart platforming to make them more available. Building systems that people love to use always starts with strong communication.

#### __*Data engineering is about more than keeping the lights on — it’s about helping people trust their tools when it matters most.*__

As I transition from research into the private sector, I’m excited to share my projects and insights on [my blog↗️](https://holland-reece.github.io/blog.html), exploring how data engineering is about more than keeping the lights on — it’s about helping people trust their tools when it matters most.
