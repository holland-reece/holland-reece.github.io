I'm a data engineer and data analyst with 3+ years of experience designing infrastructure, building data pipelines, training and delivering ML models, and leading statistical data analysis for medical research teams. I've often worked at the intersection of many multidiscipinary teams, and I specialize in building systems that make evolving digital tools accessible and highly available for every team's needs.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computational Methods and Cognitive Science, two areas of focus I chose for their utility in characterizing human decision-making in everything from mental healthcare to economic markets. I complimented these Python programming, inferential stats, and behavioral psychology chops with engineering and AI, completing Master's coursework in applied machine learning for medical imaging at Cornell University.

I applied what I learned directly to my work in a psychiatry research team at Weill Cornell Medicine, where I designed infrastructure models to aid in scaling decisions and integrated AI image processing tools into crucial data analysis pipelines for treatment development studies, one of which is now published [(Read the paper)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837059).

I've been an engineer embedded in research, engineering and clinical teams and consequently I've worn many hats - infra, database admin, dataflow, ML Ops, platform engineering, building dashboards to give updates on patient recruitment, and presenting analysis results to stakeholders. I've always approached every role with curiosity and flexibility, as well as the attention to detail required of any embedded engineer - because being an engineer is about more than just keeping the lights on, it's about giving people the confidence to depend on digital tools for their most important tasks.

As I search for opportunities to bring my data engineering and analytics skills from medical research into the private sector, I will post about my recent and ongoing projects on [my blog](https://holland-reece.github.io/blog.html). I am excited to share what I've been working on, and to begin a new chapter in my engineering journey!
