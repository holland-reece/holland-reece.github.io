# Research Skills
## Analyzing high-dimensional, multi-modal data in healthcare and clinical research
- As a computational research assistant, I analyzed high-dimensional datasets of brain images, cognitive tests and psychiatric evaluations to inform therapeutic development for psychiatric disorders.

- I helped develop a [preprocessing pipeline](https://github.com/holland-reece/SE-fMRI-Pipeline-magnitude-fieldmaps) for human brain imaging data, incorporating machine learning-based denoising tools to clarify images and identify patterns of change over time.

- I used mixed-effects linear models for repeated measures (mmrm) to quantify differences between clinical and non-clinical groups over several brain scans in randomized control trials for late-life depression and adolescent anxiety.

- In graduate courses, I applied deep learning techniques to videos of colonoscopies to segment potentially cancerous pollops.

- In a cross-institutional colaboration, I applied my experience with human health data to develop analysis scripts for a study in zebrafish larvae.

## Applying explainable AI methods to publicly available datasets
- Fitting deep learning models commonly used to analyze large datasets of medical images

- Experimentation with training techniques

- Comparison of [lasso and ridge regression techniques](https://github.com/holland-reece/ridge-vs-lasso-reg) using k-fold cross validation and forward feature selection

- Classification of MNIST data using a [logistic regression classifier](https://github.com/holland-reece/logreg-classifier-MNIST-demo)
